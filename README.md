Teaching Tool for PCA and Tsne
Originally written in Matlab and translated to Python (Collab_Python). My implementation of Tsne is missing in the Python version of Tsnedisplay.
In order to see the gradient of Tsne update you need to use the matlab live .mxe script. 

Feedback is very much welcomed. A lot of this could very well be wrong and I'd love to make it right.
